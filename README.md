- 👀 My interests... From coding, to puzzle hunts, to ctf's, to learning new skills, there's so many fun things out there and it's too hard to choose :^)
- 🌱 I'm currently looking into various topics; app dev, web dev, ai/ml, coding discord bots-- and i'm looking forward to learning it all!
- 💞️ If you'd like to collaborate on anything or talk, feel free to reach out to me!
